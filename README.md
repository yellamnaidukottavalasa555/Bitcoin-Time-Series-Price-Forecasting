# Bitcoin-Time-Series-Price-Forecasting
Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency, which is a type of digital asset that provides the basis for peer-to-peer financial transactions based on blockchain technology. One of the main problems with decentralized cryptocurrencies is price volatility, which indicates the need for studying the underlying price model. Moreover, Bitcoin prices exhibit non-stationary behaviour, where the statistical distribution of data changes over time. This paper demonstrates high-performance deep learning models for predicting Bitcoin close price forecasting. Particularly, this study compares the accuracy of the prediction of bitcoin close price using different deep learning models: Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU). In this dissertation, the results do confirm that GRU predictions have better precision in terms of forecasting errors compared to the other models.
